This OS was written by ***Nathan Hornby***

It currently requires an IDT, as that will not work no matter what I do.
###### ⚠️ Note, It will start without one, you can't do anything that requires interrupts.

IT IS x64 BIT!!! :D

## Uses [libhydrix](https://github.com/AzureianGH/libhydrix) but already comes with the required version.
